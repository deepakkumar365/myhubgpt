# Database Error Fix Summary

## Problem
The application was throwing a database error:
```
тип Error: An error occurred while executing a database query.
    at getChatById (lib\db\queries.ts:243:10)
    at async GET (app\(chat)\api\vote\route.ts:15:15)
```

## Root Cause
The error was caused by invalid UUID formats being passed to the database queries. PostgreSQL requires proper UUID format for UUID columns, and when invalid formats (like `'invalid-id'`) were passed, it threw:
```
invalid input syntax for type uuid: "invalid-id"
```

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Improved Error Handling
- Enhanced `getChatById` function to log actual database errors
- Added specific handling for UUID format errors
- Improved error messages to include the problematic ID

### 2. UUID Validation
- Created `lib/utils/validation.ts` with UUID validation utilities
- Added UUID validation to vote API routes (both GET and PATCH)
- Validates UUIDs before making database queries

### 3. Database Setup
- Created `drizzle.config.ts` for proper database configuration
- Added database migration scripts to `package.json`
- Created `DATABASE_SETUP.md` with setup instructions
- Installed missing dependencies (`server-only`, `drizzle-kit`, `tsx`)

### 4. API Route Improvements
- Added proper error handling and logging to vote routes
- Added UUID format validation before database queries
- Better error responses for invalid input

## Files Modified
- `lib/db/queries.ts` - Improved error handling
- `app/(chat)/api/vote/route.ts` - Added UUID validation
- `lib/utils/validation.ts` - New validation utilities
- `package.json` - Added database scripts and dependencies
- `drizzle.config.ts` - New database configuration

## Testing the Fix

### 1. Start the Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 2. Test with Valid UUID
The vote API should work with valid chat IDs:
```
GET /api/vote?chatId=123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000
```

### 3. Test with Invalid UUID
The API should now return a proper error instead of crashing:
```
GET /api/vote?chatId=invalid-id
```
Expected response:
```json
{
  "code": "bad_request:api",
  "message": "Invalid chatId format. Must be a valid UUID."
}
```

## Prevention
- All UUID parameters are now validated before database queries
- Better error messages help identify the source of invalid UUIDs
- Database errors are properly logged for debugging

## Next Steps
1. Check your application logs to see the improved error messages
2. Identify where invalid chat IDs are being generated
3. Consider adding UUID validation to other API routes that accept UUID parameters
